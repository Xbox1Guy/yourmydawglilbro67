to randos on the street!

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:42.166

00:03:31.104 --> 00:03:32.440
A wise decision!

You really showed them what for!

I wish he'd shoot me with his ray gun!

00:03:53.426 --> 00:03:55.773
At this rate, I will seize control of

00:03:55.773 --> 00:03:59.146
the entire west side of The Pentagram by day's end!

00:03:59.573 --> 00:04:03.666
And nothing, not a single beast in this inferno of suffering

00:04:03.666 --> 00:04:05.680

Oh boy!

Hell will be mine!

00:04:13.958 --> 00:04:16.573

What did you just say to me, you fried chicken fetuses?!

You lookin' for a fight, old man?!

Why don't you get that tinker toy bullshit

00:04:47.041 --> 00:04:49.791
off my turf before I smash it?!

You wanna go, missy?!

00:04:53.666 --> 00:04:55.750
Well, I'm happy to oblige!

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:58.080
Ahahah!

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:02.791
Good afternoon, I'm Katie Killjoy.

00:05:02.791 --> 00:05:03.979
And I'm Tom Trench!

00:05:03.979 --> 00:05:05.813
Chaos out at Pentagram City today as

00:05:05.813 --> 00:05:07.750
a turf war is raging on the west side!

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:09.880
Between notable kingpin, Sir Pentious,

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:12.970
and self-proclaimed spunky powerhouse, Cherri Bomb!

00:05:12.973 --> 00:05:14.080
That's right, Tom!

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:15.791
After the recent extermination,

00:05:15.791 --> 00:05:17.960
many areas are now up for grabs!

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:22.400
Demons all over Hell are already
duking it out to gain new territory!

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:24.906
Those two seem to be really going at it, huh?

00:05:24.906 --> 00:05:26.640
Looks like they're fighting tooth and nail

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:27.706
for that hot spot!

00:05:27.706 --> 00:05:30.083
And I'd sure like to nail her hot spot!

00:05:30.083 --> 00:05:30.400

Ugh...not again!

Ugh...not again!

Coming up next, we have an exclusive interview

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:40.791
with the daughter of Hell's own head honcho

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:44.250
who's here to discuss her brand new passion project!

00:05:44.253 --> 00:05:46.500
All that and more, after the break!

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:48.375
Suck it up, you little bi-!

Okay! You remember what to say?

00:05:53.466 --> 00:05:55.271
Yes! Let's do this!

00:05:55.271 --> 00:05:57.750
Just, look at me and I'll mouth it to you.

00:05:57.750 --> 00:05:59.293
Come on, Vaggie!

00:05:59.293 --> 00:06:01.041
I know what to say!

00:06:01.041 --> 00:06:03.133
I just feel like we need to...

00:06:03.133 --> 00:06:06.291
I don't know, make things sound more exciting!

00:06:06.291 --> 00:06:08.800
Hooo! What if I si-

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:09.453
-Sing a song about it?
Hooo! What if I si-

-Sing a song about it?

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:12.360
You knew I was gonna say that!

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:13.540
Because I know you.

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:15.380
But please don't sing!

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:16.493
This is serious!

00:06:16.493 --> 00:06:19.791
Well, you know, I'm better at expressing myself

00:06:19.791 --> 00:06:21.500
and my goals through song!

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:23.786
But life isn't a musical, hon.

00:06:23.786 --> 00:06:24.625
Fine.

00:06:24.625 --> 00:06:27.226
But I have these other ideas of what to say!

00:06:27.226 --> 00:06:29.958
The highlighted bits are the best part!

00:06:29.958 --> 00:06:32.375
Uh, it's all highlighted.

00:06:32.946 --> 00:06:34.062
Is this a drawing...?

00:06:34.062 --> 00:06:34.646
Yes!

That's the happy ending, see?!

Everyone smiling and happy in Heaven!

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:40.800
I don't think it's that simple.

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:44.906
Just please follow the talking points we went over.

00:06:44.906 --> 00:06:47.750
And do not sing!

I'd say it's a pleasure to meet you,

Tell us about this new passion project you've been

insistently pestering our news station about!

00:07:48.896 --> 00:07:50.213
Well...

00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:55.173
As most of you know, I was born here in Hell

00:07:55.173 --> 00:07:57.493
and growing up, I always tried to see

00:07:57.493 --> 00:07:59.416
the good in everyone around me.

00:07:59.970 --> 00:08:02.040
Hell is my home and-

00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:03.450
you are my people.

00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:04.625
We...

00:08:04.620 --> 00:08:07.271
we just went through another extermination.

00:08:07.271 --> 00:08:10.646
We lost so many souls, and it breaks my heart to see

00:08:10.646 --> 00:08:13.413
my people being slaughtered every year.

00:08:13.413 --> 00:08:15.813
No one is even given a chance!

00:08:15.813 --> 00:08:18.875
I can't stand idly by while the place I live

00:08:18.875 --> 00:08:20.896
is subjected to such violence!

00:08:21.312 --> 00:08:24.026
So, I've been thinking:

00:08:24.026 --> 00:08:26.208
Isn't there a more humane way

00:08:26.208 --> 00:08:28.600
to hinder overpopulation here in Hell?

00:08:28.986 --> 00:08:31.979
Perhaps we can create an alternative way

00:08:31.970 --> 00:08:34.460
to change souls through...

00:08:34.466 --> 00:08:35.333
redemption?

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:37.312
Well, I think yes!

00:16:45.986 --> 00:16:48.000
Sorry, you're stuck with me, bitch.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:49.013
Get used to it.

00:16:49.413 --> 00:16:51.521
Come mierda malparido!
(Translation: "Eat shit bastard")

00:16:51.521 --> 00:16:51.791
Listen, who cares if some jack-offs got hurt?
Come mierda malparido!
(Translation: "Eat shit bastard")

00:16:51.791 --> 00:16:54.373
Listen, who cares if some jack-offs got hurt?

00:16:54.370 --> 00:16:55.875
Most of 'em are ugly freaks.

00:16:55.875 --> 00:16:56.541
Look around!

00:16:56.541 --> 00:16:58.240
You got a bunch a fuckin' harlequin-looking babies down here!

00:16:58.240 --> 00:16:59.291
You're one to talk.

00:16:59.291 --> 00:17:00.250
Hey!

00:17:00.250 --> 00:17:02.266
This body is flawless!

00:17:02.266 --> 00:17:03.708
Everyone wants summa me,

00:17:03.708 --> 00:17:06.229
and I've got the creepy fan letters to prove it!

00:17:07.312 --> 00:17:08.293
Grrr...

00:17:08.293 --> 00:17:10.958
That was really uncool, y'know, Angel.

00:17:10.958 --> 00:17:11.750
"UNCOOL"?

00:17:11.750 --> 00:17:14.053
After that train-wreck, there is no way

00:17:14.053 --> 00:17:16.520
anyone is gonna wanna stay at the hotel!

00:17:16.520 --> 00:17:19.979
All thanks to you and your selfish bullshit!

00:17:19.979 --> 00:17:22.271
Does that mean I don't have a free room anymore?

00:17:24.693 --> 00:17:26.440
Ah, well shucks.

00:17:26.896 --> 00:17:28.080
Hey, come on.

00:17:28.080 --> 00:17:30.396
We don't know if things are over yet!

00:17:30.646 --> 00:17:32.186
Try to relax, Vaggie.

00:17:32.186 --> 00:17:34.146
I-it'll be okay!

00:17:45.933 --> 00:17:46.916
Ugh!

00:17:56.080 --> 00:17:59.786
Eh, it's probably a good idea to get some actual food in this place.

00:17:59.786 --> 00:18:03.106
Y'know, to feed all the wayward souls you got in here!

00:18:03.106 --> 00:18:04.253
Ahahaha!

00:18:04.253 --> 00:18:05.333
Ahaha...!

00:18:05.333 --> 00:18:07.354
eh... ah...

00:18:24.533 --> 00:18:25.493
Hey, mom.

00:18:26.520 --> 00:18:30.375
I know I keep calling and you must be busy...

00:18:30.375 --> 00:18:32.146
Really busy...

00:18:32.146 --> 00:18:36.437
But, um, the interview didn't go well, and...

00:18:37.026 --> 00:18:39.979
I don't know if I'm ever going to make a difference.

00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:43.160
I don't know what I'm doing.

00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:46.170
I could really use some advice, mom.

00:18:46.173 --> 00:18:50.208
I... I think dad was right about me...

00:18:51.133 --> 00:18:53.583
Ahah, oof, eh, anyway...

00:18:53.580 --> 00:18:56.600
I'll stop talking before this gets long.

00:18:56.600 --> 00:18:58.666
Love you, bye...

00:19:19.626 --> 00:19:20.600
Hel-

00:19:21.354 --> 00:19:22.466
-lo!

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:23.937
Hey, Vaggie?

00:19:23.937 --> 00:19:24.666
Whaaaat?

00:19:24.660 --> 00:19:27.396
The Radio Demon is at the door!

00:19:27.396 --> 00:19:27.979
What?!

00:19:27.979 --> 00:19:29.026
Uh... who?

00:19:29.026 --> 00:19:30.271
What should I do?!

00:19:30.680 --> 00:19:32.354
Uh, well, don't let him in!

00:19:35.880 --> 00:19:36.979
May I speak now?

00:19:37.266 --> 00:19:38.173
You may.

00:19:38.173 --> 00:19:38.560
Alastor!
You may.

00:19:38.560 --> 00:19:38.708
Alastor!

00:19:38.708 --> 00:19:40.000
Pleasure to be meeting you, sweetheart!

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:40.866
Quite a pleasure!

00:19:40.866 --> 00:19:44.250
Excuse my sudden visit, but I saw your fiasco on a picture show,

00:19:44.250 --> 00:19:45.708
and I just couldn't resist!

00:19:45.708 --> 00:19:47.333
What a performance!

00:19:47.333 --> 00:19:48.560
Why, I haven't been that entertained

00:19:48.560 --> 00:19:51.000
since the stock market crash of 1929!

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:54.041
Hahahahaha, sooo many orphans...

00:19:54.041 --> 00:19:55.426
Stop right there!

00:19:55.426 --> 00:19:57.280
Cabrón hijo de perra
(Translation: "Bastard son of a bitch")

00:19:57.280 --> 00:20:01.541
I know your game and I'm not gonna let you hurt anyone here,

00:20:01.541 --> 00:20:04.479
you pompous cheesy talkshow shitlord!

00:20:04.786 --> 00:20:08.093
Dear, if I wanted to hurt anyone here...

00:20:08.093 --> 00:20:11.416
[DISTORED]
I would've done so already...

00:20:13.626 --> 00:20:14.213
No!

00:20:14.213 --> 00:20:15.979
I'm here because I want to help!

00:20:17.173 --> 00:20:18.053
Say what now?

00:20:18.053 --> 00:20:20.208
Help! Hahaha, hello?

00:20:20.208 --> 00:20:21.541
Is this thing on?

00:20:21.541 --> 00:20:23.146
Testing, testing!

00:20:23.140 --> 00:20:25.120
Well I heard you loud and clear!

00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:27.708
Um, you want to help?

00:20:28.093 --> 00:20:29.040
With...?

00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:31.146
This ridiculous thing you're trying to do!

00:20:31.146 --> 00:20:32.416
This hotel!

00:20:32.416 --> 00:20:34.333
I want to help you run it.

00:20:34.333 --> 00:20:36.173
Buuut...

00:20:36.173 --> 00:20:36.625
why?

00:20:36.625 --> 00:20:38.875
Hahaha, why does anyone do anything?

00:20:38.875 --> 00:20:41.933
Sheer, absolute boredom!

00:20:41.933 --> 00:20:44.396
I've lacked inspiration for decades.

00:20:44.396 --> 00:20:46.166
My work became mundane,

00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:48.875
lacking focus, aimless!

00:20:48.875 --> 00:20:52.026
I've come to crave a new form of entertainment!

00:20:52.026 --> 00:20:53.506
Hahaha!

00:20:53.506 --> 00:20:57.729
Does getting into a fistfight with a reporter count as entertainment...?

00:20:57.729 --> 00:20:59.266
Hahaha!

00:20:59.266 --> 00:21:02.708
It's the purest kind, my dear: Reality!

00:21:02.708 --> 00:21:04.773
True passion!

00:21:04.773 --> 00:21:11.146
After all, the world is a stage and the stage is a world of entertainment.

00:21:11.146 --> 00:21:16.125
So does this mean you think it's possible to rehabilitate a demon?

00:21:16.125 --> 00:21:17.133
Hahahahaha!

00:21:17.133 --> 00:21:18.416
Of course not!

00:21:18.416 --> 00:21:20.208
That's wacky nonsense!

00:21:20.208 --> 00:21:23.360
Redemption, oh the non-existent humanity!

00:21:23.360 --> 00:21:25.750
No no no no, I don't think there's anything left

00:21:25.750 --> 00:21:27.625
that could save such loathsome sinners!

00:21:27.625 --> 00:21:29.866
The chance given was the life they lived before,

00:21:29.866 --> 00:21:31.666
the punishment is this!

00:21:31.666 --> 00:21:33.506
There is no undoing what is done!

00:21:33.506 --> 00:21:37.453
So then, why do you wanna help me if you don't believe in my cause?

00:21:37.453 --> 00:21:41.208
Consider it an investment in ongoing entertainment for myself!

00:21:41.208 --> 00:21:44.026
I want to watch the scum of the world struggle to climb up

00:21:44.020 --> 00:21:47.541
the hill of betterment only to repeatedly trip

00:21:47.541 --> 00:21:51.979
and tumble down to the fiery pit of failure!

00:21:53.546 --> 00:21:54.973
Riiiight.

00:21:56.521 --> 00:21:57.600
Yes, indeedy!

00:21:57.600 --> 00:22:01.346
I see big things coming your way and who better to help you than I?

00:22:01.346 --> 00:22:02.173
Uh, so...
I see big things coming your way and who better to help you than I?

00:22:02.173 --> 00:22:02.646
Uh, so...

00:22:02.646 --> 00:22:04.800
uh, what's the deal with Smiles over there?

00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:06.666
Wait, you've never heard of him before?

00:22:06.666 --> 00:22:08.400
You've been here longer than me!

00:22:08.840 --> 00:22:10.000
The Radio Demon.

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:12.906
One of the most powerful beings Hell has ever seen?

00:22:12.906 --> 00:22:14.812
Eh, not big on politics.

00:22:15.293 --> 00:22:15.896
Ugh!

00:22:16.226 --> 00:22:19.306
Decades ago, Alastor manifested in Hell,

00:22:19.306 --> 00:22:21.280
seemingly overnight.

00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:25.266
He began to topple Overlords who have been dominant for centuries.

00:22:25.266 --> 00:22:29.786
That kind of raw power had never
been harnessed by a mortal soul before.

00:22:29.786 --> 00:22:33.166
Then, he broadcast his carnage all throughout Hell

00:22:33.166 --> 00:22:35.426
just so everyone could witness his ability.

00:22:36.493 --> 00:22:41.458
Sinners started calling him
"The Radio Demon" (as lazy as that is).

00:22:41.786 --> 00:22:44.960
Many have speculated what unimaginable force enabled

00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:49.208
him to rival our world's most ancient and destructive evils.

00:22:49.626 --> 00:22:51.013
But one thing's for sure:

00:22:51.680 --> 00:22:55.979
He's an unpredictable source of danger, a wicked spirit of mystery

00:22:55.979 --> 00:22:58.933
and a violent monster of chaos, the likes of which

00:22:58.930 --> 00:23:03.666
we can't risk getting involved with unless we want to end up erased!

00:23:04.253 --> 00:23:04.937
Ya done?

00:23:05.946 --> 00:23:07.693
He looks like a strawberry pimp.

00:23:08.506 --> 00:23:10.187
Well, I don't trust him!

00:23:10.187 --> 00:23:12.600
To be fair, do you trust any man?

00:23:12.600 --> 00:23:14.875
Any men? Men?

00:23:15.646 --> 00:23:17.312
Charlie, listen to me.

00:23:17.312 --> 00:23:19.466
You can't believe this creep!

00:23:19.466 --> 00:23:21.546
He isn't just a happy face!

00:23:21.546 --> 00:23:22.840
He's a deal maker!

00:23:22.840 --> 00:23:24.466
Pure evil!

00:23:24.466 --> 00:23:26.146
He can't be redeemed!

00:23:26.146 --> 00:23:27.875
...And is most likely looking for a way

00:23:27.875 --> 00:23:29.880
to destroy everything we're trying to do!

00:23:29.880 --> 00:23:30.791
I...

00:23:30.791 --> 00:23:32.306
we don't know that!

00:23:32.306 --> 00:23:34.213
Look, I know he's bad,

00:23:34.213 --> 00:23:37.416
and I know he probably doesn't wanna change,

00:23:37.416 --> 00:23:40.750
but the whole point of this is to give people a chance!

00:23:40.750 --> 00:23:43.386
To have faith things will be better!

00:23:43.386 --> 00:23:45.546
How can I turn someone away?

00:23:45.546 --> 00:23:46.346
I can't.

00:23:46.346 --> 00:23:49.125
It goes against everything I'm trying to do.

00:23:49.125 --> 00:23:50.958
Everything I believe in.

00:23:50.950 --> 00:23:51.875
Just...

00:23:51.875 --> 00:23:53.000
trust me.

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:55.226
I can take care of myself!

00:23:55.226 --> 00:23:59.466
Charlie, whatever you do, do not make a deal with him!

00:23:59.466 --> 00:24:03.093
Don't worry, I picked up one thing from my dad!

00:24:03.093 --> 00:24:05.973
"You don't take shit from other demons!"

00:24:06.760 --> 00:24:08.880
Okay, so, Al.

00:24:08.880 --> 00:24:13.396
You're sketchy as fuck and you clearly
see what I'm trying to do here as a joke.

00:24:13.396 --> 00:24:14.646
But I don't.

00:24:15.013 --> 00:24:18.437
I think everyone deserves a chance to prove they can be better.

00:24:18.437 --> 00:24:20.746
So I'm taking your offer to help.

00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:23.375
On the condition that there be no...

00:24:23.375 --> 00:24:25.791
tricks or voodoo strings attached.

00:24:25.791 --> 00:24:28.333
So, it's a deal then?

00:24:32.493 --> 00:24:33.346
Nope!

00:24:33.346 --> 00:24:34.080
No shaking!

00:24:34.080 --> 00:24:35.013
No deals!

00:24:35.013 --> 00:24:35.680
I...

00:24:36.253 --> 00:24:37.312
hmm...

00:24:37.666 --> 00:24:41.062
As princess of Hell and heir to the throne,

00:24:41.062 --> 00:24:45.000
I, uh, hereby order that you help with this hotel.

00:24:45.293 --> 00:24:47.213
For as long as you desire.

00:24:51.293 --> 00:24:51.986
Sound fair?

00:24:51.986 --> 00:24:52.920
Hmm...

00:24:52.920 --> 00:24:54.026
Fair enough!

00:24:54.293 --> 00:24:55.437
Cool beans.

00:24:55.437 --> 00:24:57.293
Hmm hm hmm hmm...

00:24:58.646 --> 00:25:00.187
Smile, my dear!

00:25:00.187 --> 00:25:02.916
You know you're never fully dressed without one!

00:25:07.396 --> 00:25:09.312
So where is your hotel staff?

00:25:09.586 --> 00:25:11.226
Uh, well-

00:25:12.546 --> 00:25:15.791
Ohohoho, you're going to need more than that.

00:25:16.680 --> 00:25:18.896
And what can you do, my effeminate fellow?

00:25:18.890 --> 00:25:20.458
I can suck your dick!

00:25:20.458 --> 00:25:21.053
HAH!

00:25:21.053 --> 00:25:21.773
No.

00:25:22.106 --> 00:25:23.021
Your loss.

00:25:23.533 --> 00:25:25.146
Well, this just won't do!

00:25:25.312 --> 00:25:28.500
I suppose I can cash in a few favors to liven things up.

00:25:44.066 --> 00:25:46.250
This little darling is Niffty!

00:25:46.250 --> 00:25:47.854
Hi, I'm Niffty!

00:25:47.854 --> 00:25:49.229
It's nice to meet you!

00:25:49.229 --> 00:25:51.979
It's been a while since I've made new friends!

00:25:51.979 --> 00:25:53.083
Why're you all women?

00:25:53.083 --> 00:25:54.250
Are there any men here?!

00:25:54.250 --> 00:25:55.041
I'm sorry, that's rude.

00:25:55.041 --> 00:25:56.833
Oooh man, this place is filthy!

00:25:56.833 --> 00:25:58.291
It really needs a lady's touch!

00:25:58.291 --> 00:26:00.541
Which is weird because you're all ladies, no offense.

00:26:00.541 --> 00:26:02.125
Oh my gosh, this is awful!

00:26:02.120 --> 00:26:05.340
Nope! Nope! Nope! Nope!

00:26:05.346 --> 00:26:05.979
Nope!

00:26:06.786 --> 00:26:09.291
Hah! Read 'em and weep, boys!

00:26:09.290 --> 00:26:10.812
Full Ho-

00:26:12.626 --> 00:26:13.312
-tel?

00:26:13.312 --> 00:26:14.920
What the fuck is this?

00:26:15.933 --> 00:26:16.946
You!

00:26:16.946 --> 00:26:19.426
Ah, Husker, my good friend!

00:26:19.426 --> 00:26:20.375
Glad you could make it!

00:26:20.375 --> 00:26:23.213
Don't you "Husker" me, you son of a bitch!

00:26:23.213 --> 00:26:25.640
I was about to win the whole damn pot!

00:26:25.640 --> 00:26:26.937
Good to see you too!

00:26:27.253 --> 00:26:29.312
What the hell do you want with me this time...?

00:26:29.312 --> 00:26:31.250
My friend, I am doing some charity work

00:26:31.250 --> 00:26:33.916
so I took it upon myself to volunteer your services!

00:26:33.916 --> 00:26:35.706
I hope that's okay!

00:26:35.706 --> 00:26:37.213
Are you shittin' me?!

00:26:37.213 --> 00:26:38.013
Hmm...

00:26:38.013 --> 00:26:39.250
No, I don't think so!

00:26:39.979 --> 00:26:43.083
You thought it'd be some kind of big fucking riot

00:26:43.083 --> 00:26:44.791
just to pull me out of nowhere?!

00:26:44.790 --> 00:26:47.320
You think I'm some kind of fucking clown?!

00:26:47.320 --> 00:26:47.906
I ain't doing no fucking charity job.

00:26:47.906 --> 00:26:48.562
Maybe!
I ain't doing no fucking charity job.

00:26:48.562 --> 00:26:51.166
I ain't doing no fucking charity job.

00:26:51.166 --> 00:26:53.375
Well, I figured you would be the perfect face

00:26:53.375 --> 00:26:55.979
to man the front desk of this fine establishment!

00:26:56.346 --> 00:26:58.708
With your charming smile and welcoming energy,

00:26:58.708 --> 00:27:00.866
this job was made for you!

00:27:01.312 --> 00:27:05.346
Don't worry my friend, I can make this more welcoming!

00:27:05.493 --> 00:27:07.291
...If you wish.

00:27:08.946 --> 00:27:09.280
What?

00:27:09.280 --> 00:27:12.493
You think you can buy me with a wink and some cheap booze?!

00:27:13.173 --> 00:27:14.125
...Well, you can!

00:27:14.586 --> 00:27:15.213
Hey, hey!

00:27:15.210 --> 00:27:15.890
Hey, hey, hey!

00:27:15.890 --> 00:27:18.346
No! No bar, no alcohol!

00:27:18.346 --> 00:27:21.626
This is supposed to be a place that discourages sin!

00:27:21.626 --> 00:27:25.053
Not some kind of mouth, brothel, man cave!

00:27:25.053 --> 00:27:25.320
SHUT UP! SHUT! UP!
Not some kind of mouth, brothel, man cave!

00:27:25.320 --> 00:27:27.253
SHUT UP! SHUT! UP!

00:27:27.640 --> 00:27:28.906
We are keeping this!

00:27:29.600 --> 00:27:30.213
Hey~

00:27:30.213 --> 00:27:31.250
Go fuck yourself.

00:27:31.250 --> 00:27:32.916
Only if you watch me!

00:27:32.916 --> 00:27:33.958
Oh my gosh!

00:27:33.958 --> 00:27:35.979
Welcome to The Happy Hotel!

00:27:35.979 --> 00:27:38.266
You are going to love it here!

00:27:38.266 --> 00:27:40.791
I lost the ability to love years ago.

00:27:41.720 --> 00:27:43.400
So, whaddaya think?

00:27:43.400 --> 00:27:45.746
This is amazing!

00:27:46.413 --> 00:27:47.833
It's... okay.

00:27:47.833 --> 00:27:51.541

We meet yet again, Alastor!

00:28:54.053 --> 00:28:55.291
Do I know you?

00:28:56.146 --> 00:28:58.333
Oh, yes you do!

00:28:58.646 --> 00:29:01.083
And this time, I have the element of-

00:29:01.083 --> 00:29:02.208
SURPRISE!

00:29:02.600 --> 00:29:06.413
Ahaha! I'm so evil!

00:29:41.506 --> 00:29:42.653
...Well, I'm starved!

00:29:42.653 --> 00:29:44.041
Who wants some Jambalaya?

00:29:44.041 --> 00:29:46.750
My mother once showed me a wonderful recipe for Jambalaya.

00:29:46.750 --> 00:29:48.250
In fact, it nearly killed her!

00:29:48.250 --> 00:29:48.920
Hahaha!

00:29:48.920 --> 00:29:50.875

Yes, sir!

00:29:53.920 --> 00:29:57.312
This is the start of some real changes down here!

00:29:57.493 --> 00:30:01.000
The game is set! Now...

00:30:02.506 --> 00:30:04.041
