00:32.742 --> 00:38.247
[Charlie] Okay. So the extermination
is coming in six months instead of a year.

00:38.247 --> 00:41.375
No big deal.
Just a little setback.

00:41.375 --> 00:43.085
Nothing we can't handle.

00:43.085 --> 00:44.795
Just angels cutting
our timetable in half.

00:44.795 --> 00:46.630
But who needs a whole year
to save souls?

00:46.630 --> 00:48.424
[manically] Am I right?
And next time,

00:48.424 --> 00:50.176
when they cut the
time in half again and again,

00:50.176 --> 00:51.552
we'll just handle it, right?!

00:51.552 --> 00:53.721
[Vaggie] Yes, we will.

00:53.721 --> 00:57.433
[Angel] Oh, please, ya had less
than half a chance when you started

00:57.433 --> 01:00.102
all this salvation bullshit.

01:00.102 --> 01:03.439
And now... Ain't no silver
lining this time toots.

01:03.439 --> 01:07.735
Sure there is. We just have to
look a little harder for it.

01:07.735 --> 01:11.655
Well, while you're lookin,
the rest of Hell is going nuts.

01:11.655 --> 01:14.492
People are already freaking out
about the news.

01:14.492 --> 01:17.453
Look at what's happening in the
Doomsday District.

01:17.453 --> 01:19.622
Err, what is
a "donkey show"?

01:19.622 --> 01:24.668
Aah, heh, nothing. My boss, Val,
is just freaked out about the news, too.

01:24.668 --> 01:26.629
Like I said,
everyone's losing their shit.

01:26.629 --> 01:30.883
Yeah, that's true.
Sinners are desperate.

01:30.883 --> 01:35.638
Maybe desperate enough to try
anything to escape the extermination?

01:35.638 --> 01:41.894
[gasps] This is the perfect time
to recruit more sinners for the hotel!

01:41.894 --> 01:45.439
Cute idea and all,
but you really going to go out in all of this?

01:45.439 --> 01:48.359
Well, it's not like people are
just going to show up on our doorstep.

[shouts]
Face my wrath!

01:59.912 --> 02:01.247
Who are you?

02:01.247 --> 02:04.500
Who am I?
Who am I?

02:04.500 --> 02:11.507
I am the great Sir Pentious! Inventor,
architect of destruction,

02:11.507 --> 02:14.301

02:14.301 --> 02:16.804
Woo! You tell 'em, boss.

[Niffty gasps]
Ooh, he's a bad boy.

02:20.349 --> 02:22.685
Huh, well if all that's true,
you'd think I'd have heard of you.

02:22.685 --> 02:25.354
I attacked
you literally last week.

02:25.354 --> 02:28.732
We've done battle, like... 20
times.

02:28.732 --> 02:31.610
Well, you must have been
really bad at this.

02:31.610 --> 02:33.946
Silence! Now cower!

02:33.946 --> 02:38.284
[hisses] For when I've
slain you, the almighty Vees

02:38.284 --> 02:41.537
will finally acknowledge me
as their equal!

02:41.537 --> 02:44.373
[Niffty]
Ooh! Wait, who are the Vees?

02:44.373 --> 02:46.458
Oh, nobody important.

for you over here. Mr Vox

03:53.442 --> 03:56.445
Mr. Vox. What are your thoughts
on the new extermination deadline?

03:56.445 --> 04:01.283
My dear people, we at VoxTek

04:01.283 --> 04:03.869

04:03.869 --> 04:09.458

to your protection.

We are pleased to announce
VoxTek Angelic Security is coming soon.

Sir? Uh, when did we begin
working on Angelic Security?

04:27.518 --> 04:30.771
[Vox] 30 seconds ago. Try to
get that bitch Carmilla on the books

04:30.771 --> 04:32.648
and cancel all my
appointments today.

04:32.648 --> 04:34.692

Is it 1750?

04:47.871 --> 04:49.915
Burn it like the witches
who wore it.

04:49.915 --> 04:52.334
[Vox] Oh, Velvet.
I can see you're busy.

04:52.334 --> 04:54.545
Tell me where's our hot
headed friend now?

04:54.545 --> 04:59.049
Up in his tower, waiting for
a flat-faced prince to calm him down.

04:59.049 --> 05:04.346
[sighs] And uh, what's got him
so out of sorts today?

05:04.346 --> 05:07.516
Who knows?
But he tore up my best model.

05:07.516 --> 05:10.352
And you know, the show can't
wait for that unlucky bitch

05:10.352 --> 05:12.021

05:12.021 --> 05:14.356

No. No. Hideous.

I want to die. Eww.
Oh, yes. That's the one.

05:18.360 --> 05:20.112
Well, looks like you have
everything under control here.

05:20.112 --> 05:22.573
Of course I do.
Fuck you. Now shoo!

[glass smashes]
Kitty, another drink.

05:38.464 --> 05:40.632
Can you believe what
that piece of shit did?

05:40.632 --> 05:43.552
The ungrateful whore!
[glass smashes]

05:43.552 --> 05:45.387
Um which whore are
we talking about this time?

05:45.387 --> 05:47.056
Fucking Angel Dust.

05:47.056 --> 05:49.475
Who the hell else
would I be talking about?

05:49.850 --> 05:53.437
That fucking slut
walked out on me. Me.

05:53.437 --> 05:54.897
I fucking made him.

05:54.897 --> 05:56.732
Without me, he's just a bag of
meat

05:56.732 --> 05:58.650
with some mildly
entertaining holes.

05:58.650 --> 06:01.612
- Angel quit?
- No, he didn't fucking quit.

06:01.612 --> 06:04.615
It's worse. He moved!

06:04.615 --> 06:08.535
He thinks he can just walk in here,
work, and then go home somewhere else.

06:08.535 --> 06:10.120
Can you fucking believe that?!

06:10.120 --> 06:11.872
He thinks he can run off

06:11.872 --> 06:13.916
and shack up with Lucifer's
bimbo daughter?

06:13.916 --> 06:16.752
Angel is living with
Lucifer's daughter now?

06:16.752 --> 06:19.463
Yeah, that bitch. Chalkie,
or Chandler, or...

06:19.463 --> 06:20.589
I don't know.
Something mannish like that.

06:20.589 --> 06:22.091
She's got this hotel and--

06:22.091 --> 06:24.134
And which of these makes me
look sexier?

06:24.134 --> 06:26.095
[Vox chuckles]
What are you doing, Val?

06:26.095 --> 06:28.097
You're not going over there.

06:28.097 --> 06:31.600
That slippery twink is
going to remember who owns him.

06:31.600 --> 06:34.937
I'm going to fuck everyone in
that rancid shithole, I swear to God.

06:34.937 --> 06:37.981
[shouts] Val!
[chuckles] Think about it.

06:37.981 --> 06:40.484
Our brand is perfection.

06:40.484 --> 06:42.694
And what do you think
chasing whores around town

06:42.694 --> 06:44.196
will do for our image?

06:44.196 --> 06:46.657
Uh... Fuck it up?

06:46.657 --> 06:48.700
Right!
[cheering]

06:48.700 --> 06:51.787
Do you want people thinking you
can't control your employees?

06:51.787 --> 06:53.622
- No.
- Exactly.

06:53.622 --> 06:56.667
And, hey, you still have him
under contract.

06:56.667 --> 07:00.546
He isn't going anywhere.
So you should...?

07:00.963 --> 07:02.923
[Valentino] Do nothing?

07:02.923 --> 07:06.760
Great idea. Now, that's
why they pay you the big bucks.

07:06.760 --> 07:09.888
[sighs] But I really wanted
to shoot someone.

07:09.888 --> 07:12.724
Well, let me call up the lowest
earners this month.

07:12.724 --> 07:16.937
Oh, you know me too well.
[chuckles darkly]

07:19.565 --> 07:24.069
You know, Angel isn't the only
one spending time at this ratty hotel

07:24.069 --> 07:26.155
with the devil's <i>princessa</i> .

07:26.155 --> 07:28.949
[Vox] Oh, who else is there?
Someone who owes you money?

07:28.949 --> 07:32.661
[chuckles] Someone who owes
us much more than money.

07:32.661 --> 07:34.204
The Radio Demon is there.

07:34.204 --> 07:36.748
[tense music]

07:36.748 --> 07:38.750
[chuckles]
What did you just say?

07:38.750 --> 07:40.544
You heard me.

07:40.544 --> 07:45.048
Alastor came back and he is with
Lucifer's daughter,

07:45.048 --> 07:49.052
[angrily] and that wasn't
the first fucking thing you told me?!

07:49.052 --> 07:52.014
[Valentino] Hey, killing Alastor
is your kink.

07:53.515 --> 07:57.019
[Sir Pentious] Arrgh,
Oh! Please! Stop! [Alastor laughs]

07:57.019 --> 07:59.104
[Charlie] Um, Alastor?
I think he's had enough.

07:59.104 --> 08:02.149
[Angel] Nah, he's got a few more
hits in im!

08:02.149 --> 08:04.026
[dramatic music]
[Sir Pentious] Aahhh!

08:04.026 --> 08:07.863
[Alastor] Thanks for
another forgettable experience.

08:08.572 --> 08:12.159
[Sit Pentious] Thank... you...
for letting your guard down!

08:12.159 --> 08:14.494
Haha! Yah! Oh, shit.

08:14.953 --> 08:20.000
[Sir Pentious screams]
Argh!

08:20.000 --> 08:22.794
Well, it looks as though
I need a visit to the tailor.

08:22.794 --> 08:24.713
Best of luck, chums.

08:24.713 --> 08:26.632
Wait. You're leaving?

08:26.632 --> 08:29.551
Alastor, we need your help.
We need you to do your job.

08:29.551 --> 08:30.302
We need a wall.

08:30.302 --> 08:32.221
Of course.

08:32.221 --> 08:34.890
Can't let my new project fall
into disrepair already.

08:34.890 --> 08:36.141
What would the papers say?

08:36.141 --> 08:39.853
[Angel giggles]

08:39.853 --> 08:42.564
Hey, sweet cheeks.
[laid back jazz]

08:42.564 --> 08:43.982
What you doing later?

08:43.982 --> 08:47.861
I love me a man with a giant...
tool.

08:47.861 --> 08:50.072
[Valentino] See? Look,
at how he flirts with that guy,

08:50.072 --> 08:52.074
and he's not even paying.

08:52.074 --> 08:55.244
Who is that? I'm gonna fucking
kill his whole fucking family.

That fucker is back!

09:02.251 --> 09:04.670
Yeah, I thought he was gone
for good too.

09:04.670 --> 09:06.255
It's been seven years!

09:06.255 --> 09:09.007
You still pissed
he almost beat you that time?

09:09.007 --> 09:11.760
- Uh, fuck you.
- Just saying.

09:11.760 --> 09:13.887
Things have changed a lot
since he left town.

09:13.887 --> 09:15.180
[Valentino] That's for sure.

09:15.180 --> 09:16.765
I got to send a message
